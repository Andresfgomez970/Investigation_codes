General comments about data in/out are done in the routines as well as their specific purpose

----------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The following are the dependencies of the .h files and their goal

-------------------------------------------
input_ouput.h : none

This program seeks to have general and useful input-output funtions that could be used with data in different situations.

--

-------------------------------------------
two_body_aalytical.h : input_output.h

This programs seeks to have different useful routines about the two body problem. 

--

-------------------------------------------
montecarlo.h : none

This programs seeks to have different useful routines about the montecarlo methodology. 

--

-------------------------------------------
mappings.h :    input_output.h montecarlo.h two_body_analytical.h

This programs seeks to have functions to be mapped and routines to map such functions under different constrains.
