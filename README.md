# Abstract

The mechanical state that can be constructed from observations for a pair of inter
acting galaxies is investigated. For that we define the orbital structure of a system
as the probability density distribution of the possible states given the available ob
servations with the purpose of easily estimating any physical property of the system
with a meaningful error. We propose two approaches to the orbital structure. In one,
the interacting galaxies are studied in an early stage as a two body problem and a
distribution function of the orbital elements is obtained based on the observation of
the positions of the galaxies in the sky as well as its velocities along the line-of-sight.
Important symmetries, simplifications and interpretations concerning the nature of
the interaction of the pair are obtained from the analysis of the resultant orbital
structure. In the second one, we consider interacting pairs in which tidal features are
present and can be unequivocally associated to a given disk. A mapping from the tidal
regions to the possible orientations of the disk with respect to the angular momentum
of the two body orbit is proposed. We perform a statistical analysis for systems in
which one galaxy is face-on (with ùëñ = 0) and other have any inclination with angle
of periapsis ùë§ = 0. The result shows that the mapping proposed can determine the
orientation within a solid angle of ‚âà 0.03(4ùúã) with a confidence interval of 99% in
the worst case scenario. The last under the assumption that with the exception of
the galaxies‚Äô orientation the rest of the parameters are known and observations with
uniformly high resolution and signal-to-noise ratio are present (these observations are
modeled).
